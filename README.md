## **Findings**

During the audit, the following extensions were flagged and removed:

1. **Online PDF Converter**

   * **Issue:** Requested excessive permissions and connected to unknown external resources.
   * **Action Taken:** Removed due to high risk of data exposure.

2. **Flash Player for the Web**

   * **Issue:** Relied on deprecated Flash technology, which is no longer supported and has known vulnerabilities.
   * **Action Taken:** Removed to eliminate security threats.

**Outcome:**
After removing these extensions, there was a noticeable improvement in browser startup time and overall performance. Risk exposure was reduced, enhancing browsing security.

## **Recommendations**

* Conduct a browser extension audit at least once every few months.
* Install extensions only from verified and reputable sources (e.g., Chrome Web Store).
* Review extension permissions before installation — avoid extensions requesting access to **all websites** or sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.
* Promptly remove extensions that are unused, outdated, or suspicious.
* Keep your browser and extensions up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
