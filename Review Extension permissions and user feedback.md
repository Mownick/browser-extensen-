###  Observations

* **High-permission extensions** (e.g., Grammarly, Adobe Acrobat) are generally safe but should be reviewed periodically due to the sensitive nature of the access they require.
* **Online PDF Converter** and **Flash Player for the Web** raised multiple red flags:

  * Permissions not justified by their claimed functionality.
  * Poor user ratings and reviews citing redirects and potential malicious behavior.
  * Use of deprecated or risky technology (e.g., Flash).

###  Conclusion

Based on the permission analysis and user feedback:

* **Retained:**

  * Grammarly
  * Adobe Acrobat
  * Google Docs Offline
* **Removed:**

  * Online PDF Converter
  * Flash Player for the Web

These actions contribute to a more secure and privacy-respecting browsing environment.
